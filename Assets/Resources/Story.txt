You are a scientist named Peter, who works in a research facility that studies ways to reanimate animal tissue. 

During one experiment, a chemical compound you developed accidentally triggered a violent mutation, which exposed a contagious gas that spread outside the lab. Within days, the gas transformed most living creatures into zombies.

Amid the chaos, your former lab partner, Isaac, managed to create the foundation for a cure, but vanished before completing it. With the outbreak worsening, you must retrace their research, gather the remaining ingredients, and finish the cure yourself. 

Your mission: To find your lab partner and finish making the cure. 

Humanity depends on it.
